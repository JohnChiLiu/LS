# Below we have given you an array and a number.
# Write a program that checks to see if the number appears in the array.

#arr.include?(number)

# What will the following programs return? What is value of arr after each?

#returns 1, it is the value attached to b1 once the product formula is used
#to combine each item in array with a range of values
#arr = [b,b2,b3,c1,c2,c3,d1,d2,d3]
#returns [1,2,3]
#arr = [[b],[b,[1,2,3]]]

# How do you return the word "example" from the following array?
#array[1][0]

#What does each method return in the following example?

#3,error,8

#What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?

#e,A,nil

#6 => add .to_i to the end of a method

#Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array
# that is the result of incrementing each value in
# the original array by a value of 2

# array = [1,3,4]
# array.map {|n| puts n * 2}

# puts array
