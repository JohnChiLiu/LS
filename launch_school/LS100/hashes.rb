# Given a hash of family members, with keys as the title and
# an array of names as the values, use Ruby's built-in
# select method to gather only immediate family members' names into a new array.

# immediate_members = family.select do |k,v|
#   k == :sisters || k == :brothers
# end

# array = []
# immediate_members.each do |k,v|
#   array << v
# end

# puts array

#merge does not mutate

#hash.each do |k,v|
  #puts k or v
#end

#person[:name]

#hash.has_value?()

#first create an empty array, next perform a loop through the strings, then
#split, join, and reverse string. if this reversal matches the original string,
#then this will be added to the empty array that counts anagrams

#first is a symbol, second is variable

#B
