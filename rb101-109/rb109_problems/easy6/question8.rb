# Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the array occurs twice (every other value occurs exactly once), how would you determine which value occurs twice? Write a method that will find and return the duplicate value that is known to be in the array.

# Examples:

# find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
# find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
#           38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
#           14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
#           78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
#           89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
#           41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
#           55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
#           85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
#           40, 23, 71, 62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
#           7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73

# Question:
# Write a method that takes an array of integers and return the element that is repeated twice. 

# Input vs Output:
# Input: array of integers
# Output: integers

# Explicit vs Implicit Rules:
# Explicit:
# 1) We are searching within array to see which element is repeated twice.
# Implicit:
# N/A 

# Algorithm:

# find_dup method

# 1) initialize new hash called 'result'
# 2) iterate through 'array' with each method, each iteration setting 'result' key to integer and 
# invoke count method on array while passing in integer
# 3) now that we have 'result' hash with frequencies of each integer, return result.key(2)

def find_dup(array)
  result = {}
  array.each do |integer|
    result[integer] = array.count(integer)
  end
  result.key(2)
end
