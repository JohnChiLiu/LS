# Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

# Question:
# Write a method that takes in an integer and returns its square

# Explicit vs Implicit
# Explicit:
# 1. use multiply method
# 2. return the square
# Implicit
# 1. square is **

# Input vs output
# Input:
# 1. integer
# 2. integer

# Algorithm:
# square method

def product(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

def square(num)
  product(num, num)
end

p square(5)
